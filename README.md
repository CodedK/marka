## Building Docs

Marka using Jekyll to generate documentation, 
so you can run documentation locally in your computer with Jekyll's help. 

1. Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.1.x), if you haven't installed it yet. (**Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.)
2. Clone Marka repository `git clone git@github.com:fians/marka.git` or `git clone https://github.com/fians/marka.git`
3. From the root directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and that's it.
