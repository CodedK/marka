FAQ

1. **Browser support?**
	- Marka heavily depends on CSS3 transform and transition.
	So, it should work on latest version of Chrome, Mozilla, Safari
	and Opera. And off course IE10+.

2. **I found a bug, where should I reported to?**
	- Oh, great! Just report the issue in [Marka's Github repo](https://github.com/fians/marka/issues).
